# Kumu

This is an incomplete Node-based project for personal use.

In it's current development state, it is a loopback installation with data structure defined, so a very basic working REST API. It is not currently useful for anything.

"kumu" is a Hawaiian word for teacher.

## Angular 2

This branch is for setting up a foundation using angular 2 instead. It will emulate the methods used in [Qeti project](https://github.com/Qeti/Qeti). And explained in this [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34843235/is-it-possible-to-generate-services-for-angular2-from-loopback).

## Install

```
$ npm install
