# Kumu

This is an incomplete Node-based project for personal use.

In it's current development state, it is a loopback installation with data structure defined, so a very basic working REST API. It is not currently useful for anything.

"kumu" is a Hawaiian word for teacher.

## Install

First, install dependencies by entering the following from a terminal inside this directory:
```
$ npm install
```
Now all is ready. To launch development servers reloading on any relevant changes run:
```
$ npm run dev
```
